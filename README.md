# Interactive Visualization Tool

## Get Started
Project Dependencies:
* Node & npm
* R & Rserve

Before you start the server, you need start Rserve in advance.
Run in shell:
```
library(Rserve)
Rserve(args="--no-save")
```
Run in shell:
```shell
cd interactive-visualization-tool
npm install
node app.js
```

## Notice
* Now the data is stored in localStorage and I use default settings. This will be fixed in the future.
